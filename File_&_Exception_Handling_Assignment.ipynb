        "**Ans:** Interpreted and compiled languages differ primarily in how their source code is translated and executed by a computer:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Compiled Languages:** In a compiled language (like C, C++, Java), the source code is translated into machine code (or an intermediate bytecode) by a program called a compiler before the program is run. This machine code is then saved as an executable file. When you run the program, the operating system loads this pre-compiled executable directly, which generally results in faster execution speeds. If you want to run the program on a different operating system or architecture, you typically need to recompile it for that specific environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Interpreted Languages:** In an interpreted language (like Python, JavaScript, Ruby), the source code is translated and executed line by line by a program called an interpreter at runtime. There is no separate compilation step that produces an executable file. The interpreter reads a line of code, translates it, and executes it immediately before moving to the next line. This process can be slower than compiled languages because the translation happens every time the program runs. However, interpreted languages are often more portable, as the same source code can be run on different platforms as long as an appropriate interpreter is installed."
